# Biweekly Report for the Bot Project

**Subject**: Milestone I - Summary of Current Work, Further Implementation of Algorithms and Visualizations, Project Unification

**Project Title**: BotWheels

**Report Number**: 3

**Date**: November 11, 2024

**Week Range**: Weeks 5-6

## 1. Progress Overview

The overall engagement from the team has decreased in recent weeks. Currently, we are focusing on unifying the project approach and developing a simple CLI to improve usability. At the same time, we are continuing to refine the PPO and A2C/A3C algorithms, with particular attention to improving the reward module for better performance.

## 3. Challenges and Problems Encountered

There have been communication issues with some team members, along with reduced overall engagement compared to the project's start. This has led to delays in delivering solutions. Additionally, some individuals have taken on significant responsibility for the team, resulting in a relatively large workload for them, but this has helped move the project forward.

## 4. Plans for the Next Period (Weeks 7-8)

In the next period, the goal is to deliver the CLI and a more effectively trained bot capable of consistently performing actions, such as scoring goals. The bot's performance will be evaluated based on predefined criteria leading to ensure it meets the expected outcomes. Initial measurements will be taken to compare the bot’s behavior against the assumptions made during the planning stages, providing a foundation for further refinement and adjustments.

## 5. Summary

Improved self-motivation within the team is expected to lead to better coordination and more consistent progress. With increased individual drive, the team members will be more proactive in completing tasks and communicating effectively, which should help streamline the development process. This motivation is crucial for ensuring that everyone stays focused on their responsibilities and contributes to the overall success of the project.
