# Biweekly Report for the Bot Project

**Subject**: Initial Implementation of RL Algorithms and Addition of Fundamental Visualizations

**Project Title**: BotWheels

**Report Number**: 2

**Date**: October 27, 2024

**Week Range**: Weeks 3-4

## 1. Progress Overview

Significant progress has been made with the development of base PPO and A2C/A3C algorithms, which are already yielding training results. Extensive state visualizations have been implemented with further expansions possible. Weekly goals are largely being met, with some even ahead of schedule, supporting a favorable outlook for project completion. A team member has proposed Rocket Learn, a tool from the RLGym community that facilitates advanced bot training. This tool has been assigned for parallel development as a potential approach.

## 3. Challenges and Problems Encountered

One primary challenge was task ambiguity, which will be addressed through clearer task descriptions. Task delivery delays from certain team members have occasionally slowed progress. Additionally, a need for training equipment, such as virtual machines and access to university resources, was identified.

## 4. Plans for the Next Period (Weeks 5-6)

Deliver refined RL algorithms that incorporate Rocket League-specific rewards. Visualization work will continue, with graphic adjustments and additional features as needed. A performance metric tool will be developed to meet project requirements and evaluate trained bots’ effectiveness.

## 5. Summary

Project progress is on track, with issues being addressed as they arise.
