# Biweekly Report for the Bot Project

**Subject**: Milestone II - Model Training, Pipeline Refinement, and Final Project Adjustments

**Project Title**: BotWheels

**Report Number**: 5

**Date**: December 9, 2024

**Week Range**: Weeks 9-11

## 1. Progress Overview

Due to the approaching deadline for thesis submissions, overall team engagement in the project has decreased, which is understandable. Currently, the focus remains on training the models and refining the main project pipeline. The expected deliverables include fully trained models, detailed documentation for the training process, and well-commented code to ensure clarity and maintainability.

The training of both models is progressing, but delays are anticipated due to the reduced availability of some team members. Despite these challenges, efforts are ongoing to meet the key milestones, and adjustments are being made to optimize the model's performance.

## 3. Challenges and Problems Encountered

The improper distribution of tasks during the initial weeks has impacted the latter stages, which coincide with thesis submission deadlines. As a result, there has been less time dedicated to the project, with fewer people actively engaged. Communication issues remain the primary challenge, which has led to delays and inefficiencies in task completion.

## 4. Plans for the Next Period

As established, the final submission of the project will occur during the wrap-up session. By that time, fully trained models are expected to be delivered, along with completed tests and any necessary adjustments. Additionally, the project documentation will be finalized to provide a clear overview of the model training process and final results.

## 5. Summary

Despite challenges related to reduced availability and communication issues, progress is being made toward the completion of the project. The team is focused on finalizing the model training and refining the project pipeline to meet the established goals. The upcoming period will be critical for delivering the final results, ensuring the models are trained as expected, and preparing the project for final presentation.
