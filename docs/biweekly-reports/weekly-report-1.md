# BoT Project Biweekly Report

**Subject**: Beginning of the Project

**Project Title**: BotWheels

**Report Number**: 1

**Date**: October 12, 2024

**Week Range**: Weeks 1-2

## 1. Progress Overview

During this period, tasks were completed to lay solid foundations for the entire project. The focus was on distributing tasks related to research and structuring work with the repository. Linters for Python (Ruff) and a markdown linter were introduced, unifying the workflow of the project.

Setting up the local development environment for all team members was a main task, ensuring everyone could work on the project locally. Some team members committed to their tasks effectively, resulting in progress ahead of schedule in certain areas. However, delays were experienced in others.

The team successfully diagnosed and preliminarily implemented visualizations of the bot's environment states, exceeding weekly project assumptions. This is expected to positively impact the implementation of an effective bot and the development of the PPO and A2C/A3C algorithms. An increase in the number of researched topics can be observed in the docs repository, which are being integrated into the core repository on separate branches. Weekly status meetings are conducted every Wednesday at 20:00.

| **Jakub Cisoń**         | 4.5      | Led the team and conducted research on the bot's gameplay in an online game, focusing on anti-cheat detection. Task distribution errors occurred, leading to some members not receiving assignments. The absence of a management system was identified and corrected, improving future task planning. Efforts will be made to better match task sizes for equitable workloads. | - [Research security systems of Rocket League and Anti-Cheat statements](https://github.com/bot-wheels/bot-wheels-core/issues/28) |

## 3. Challenges and Problems Encountered

The person responsible for the initial implementation of the DQN algorithm did not fulfill their task, leading to the decision to abandon this approach for now. As an equivalent, documentation was prepared on this approach, which will serve as a foundation for future implementation if sufficient time and resources become available.

Some tasks are blocking the progress of other tasks, slowing down overall workflow and distribution. The engagement of group members is very varied, leading to communication problems and, as mentioned earlier, mutual blocking of tasks.

## 4. Plans for the Next Period (Weeks 3-4)

A better implementation strategy will be developed, and the distribution of human resources will be changed. Direct addressing of issues will be implemented to avoid blocking. A new task management system will be created based on the experience from the previous two weeks. A task planning system for the next few weeks will also be established. The A2C and PPO algorithms will be implemented, focusing on improving core functionalities.

## 5. Summary

In summary, the project started well but faced significant challenges during the first two weeks due to miscommunication regarding task assignments and varied engagement from team members. Plans for the next period aim to establish clearer roles and responsibilities to ensure smoother progress.
