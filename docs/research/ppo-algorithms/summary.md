# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) - Summary

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a popular and efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm introduced by OpenAI as an improvement over older policy gradient methods like Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). PPO finds a balance between performance and computational efficiency, making it a suitable choice for a wide range of RL tasks.

## 1. Theoretical Background

PPO belongs to the family of policy gradient algorithms, which learn the agent's policy (decision function) directly. The key objective in PPO is to optimize the reward function while maintaining training stability and preventing large updates to the policy, which could lead to instability.

To achieve this, PPO introduces a constraint on how much the policy can change between updates. It uses a *clipped* objective function to prevent significant shifts in policy in a single update step. This approach makes PPO simpler and more computationally efficient compared to other algorithms like TRPO, which require more complex computations.

## 2. PPO Mechanisms

PPO operates through:

- **Objective Function**: PPO maximizes the reward function while applying a *clip* constraint on the ratio of probabilities between the old and new policy to avoid large, destructive updates.
- **Multiple Update Steps**: PPO uses mini-batches of samples for efficient gradient updates, allowing for more stable and effective learning.
- **Advantage Estimation**: PPO often uses Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) to accurately and stably estimate the advantage that the agent gains in a given situation.

## 3. Why PPO?

PPO was chosen for the following reasons:

- **Training Stability**: PPO restricts policy changes, reducing the risk of instability often seen in other policy gradient methods.
- **Simplicity of Implementation**: Unlike TRPO, PPO is simpler to implement, making it easier to integrate and optimize within the project.
- **Computational Efficiency**: The algorithm does not require costly computations, such as calculating the Hessian (second derivative), making it efficient and fast.
